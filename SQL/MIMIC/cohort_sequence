-- This cohort is derived from multiple other materialized views and tables from the MIMIC-III 
-- git hub repository  (https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/tree/master/concepts),
-- which were either used directly or modified.

-- Reference for SOFA:
--    Jean-Louis Vincent, Rui Moreno, Jukka Takala, Sheila Willatts, Arnaldo De Mendon√ßa,
--    Hajo Bruining, C. K. Reinhart, Peter M Suter, and L. G. Thijs.
--    "The SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) score to describe organ dysfunction/failure."
--    Intensive care medicine 22, no. 7 (1996): 707-710.

-- Variables used in SOFA:
--  GCS, MAP, FiO2, Ventilation status (sourced from CHARTEVENTS)
--  Creatinine, Bilirubin, FiO2, PaO2, Platelets (sourced from LABEVENTS)
--  Dopamine, Dobutamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine (sourced from INPUTEVENTS_MV and INPUTEVENTS_CV)
--  Urine output (sourced from OUTPUTEVENTS)

-- The following views required to run the SOFA query:
--  1) pivoted_bg_art - generated by pivoted-bg.sql
--  2) pivoted_uo - generated by pivoted-uo.sql
--  3) pivoted_lab - generated by pivoted-lab.sql
--  4) pivoted_gcs - generated by pivoted-gcs.sql
--  5) ventdurations - generated by ../durations/ventilation-durations.sql
--  6) norepinephrine_dose - generated by ../durations/norepinephrine-dose.sql
--  7) epinephrine_dose - generated by ../durations/epinephrine-dose.sql
--  8) dopamine_dose - generated by ../durations/dopamine-dose.sql
--  9) dobutamine_dose - generated by ../durations/dobutamine-dose.sql

-- The following was also used for the final table:
-- 1) icustay_detail - generated by icustay-detail.sql

-- In addition to the tables used for SOFA, the modified tables used in this query are found at:
